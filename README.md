ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhonglin Zhao

ðŸŽ“ Passionate educator | ðŸ’» Code enthusiast | ðŸ§  Consultant

I specialize in using the power of code to empower students and drive business growth. Whether in the classroom or the boardroom, I love turning complex ideas into practical solutions that make a real impact.

Iâ€™m currently working on Python, Java, and MySQL projects with Financial Analysis and Consulting Projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About
	-Building a strong programming foundation (especially for non-CS students)
  -How to get into top universities in the USA & UK
	-Crafting personal statement and college application strategy
	-Turning a vague idea into a data-backed, presentable project
